In my previous article I gave some initial impressions on ECDesigns' "sound system": the powerDAC-S and open baffle speakers.

I had build the speakers out of curiosity. I was skeptical that I would end up keeping such large and "intrusive" speakers in my flat. I do not have a dedicated listening space, outside of a smaller room that I use as my home office. My plan, where I to keep them, was to have them stored in that small room and wheel them out into my living room when I wanted to use them. Is so much effort really required to enjoy music, one could ask ? Why go through all this trouble ?

In addition, from an "acoustic" standpoint, my living room is not ideal. I did manage to find an optimal placement for the speakers. Additional furniture, and curtains, also contributed to improved acoustics.

I continued "tweaking" the speakers for a while, gradually reducing their size. I did experiment with using 3 instead of 4 speaker drivers per baffle, in an attempt to make them even more discrete, but the sound quality really suffered. 

I found a simple way to move the speakers around by installing "casters for upright pianos":
