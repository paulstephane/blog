*May 2022*

This review should be read as a follow up to my previous [review of ECdesigns' powerDAC-R](/PDR-Preview.md).

That first review introduced the reader to ECdesigns' approach and "philosophy", and provided a lot of background technical information, but was brief when it comes to sonic impressions. All truth be told, the powerDAC-R left me a little frustrated. As ECdesigns explains, and most audiophiles know well, the end result of an audio system is the product of all its compenents. However well a DAC performs, the sound you hear depends as much on the quality of the amplifier and speaker it is paired with.

When ECdesigns suggested I test their new model, the powerDAC-S, I was excited to find out what improvements I could get listening to my speakers directly connected to the powerDAC, so without any "traditional" amplifier. As stated on their [home page](https://www.ecdesigns.nl/):

>"Every component in an audio chain is imperfect and introduces extra degradation. Less components in an audio chain will give less degradation. Our PowerDAC-R makes it possible to remove the pre-amp from the audio chain and directly drive the amplifier. The PowerDAC-S now also removes the amplifier from the audio chain. The only thing left is a balanced power-supply and resistor attenuator that directly drive the speaker."

One can refer to their [documentation](https://www.ecdesigns.nl/00dc/powerdac-s.pdf) to understand how the powerDAC-S works and why it is so unique. It is designed along the same solutions as the powerDAC-R, but offers higher output power and the ability to drive speakers (output power is limited to 4 watts per channel). The devil is in the details, and designing what seems like a minimal system is in fact quite complex, but to put it simply, one can view the powerDAC-S as a "straight wire with attenuation" (to paraphrase the "straight wire with gain" ideal system that audiophiles dream about). One will not find any other system with such a minimalistic design and so few components in the signal path.

When I first received the powerDAC-S (which I purchased at full retail price - it is worth mentioning that I am a regular customer), I used it with my modest (i.e. not "high end") Davis Courbet 4 speakers. I could perceive the benefits of removing my amplifier (a Lavardin ITX) from the sytem. The direct connection of the powerDAC-S to the speakers offered a more natural sound. Yet, I felt things could be taken even further. Listening to the powerDAC-S with a variety of other (often more expensive) speakers did not convince me either that all the potential of the powerDAC-S was being realized.

ECDesigns suggests pairing the powerDAC-S with speakers of their own design. These open baffle speakers use 4 Tang Band W8-2145 full range drivers in parallel, without any crossover filter (as crossover components bring their share of distortion). With a 102db/1W/1m rating, and 2 Ohm impedance, they are well suited to the powerDAC-S, which is limited to 4W per channel. The TangBand drivers have a relatively flat frequency response for full-range speakers, and offer low distortion (manufacturer's claims). I had head the smaller Tang Band W5-1880 used as full-range, and while limited in the lower frequency, I had enjoyed their very transparent and refined sound.

ECDesigns send me a few more comments to explain why they chose these speakers:

>"We selected this specific speaker as it has very low distortion and a flat SPL (very rare for an 8" full range speaker). We used an 8" speaker because it offers a large membrane surface area = higher resolution. This driver has a membrane made from banana plant fiber. This membrane and the whizzer cone are treated with a gel like (sticky) damping material applied to the rear of the membrane and whizzer cone.  This may have fixed the peaks we see with drivers based on paper or paper kevlar membrane.    
>
>It has underhung motor, this means the entire voice coils always stays within the magnetic gap for very low distortion, higher efficiency (almost all power is converted to motion) and low moving mass (smaller voice coil).    
>
>Finally these full range speakers have very low inductance, this translates to a very fast response (larger voice coil inductance = higher impedance at higher frequencies or transients = slower response)."

ECDesigns does not sell these open baffle speakers. They provide the [specifications](https://www.ecdesigns.nl/00dc/ob-speakers.pdf) to build them on your own.

I was hesitant to engage in this project, as I am not an experienced DIYer ... Sourcing the wood, getting it cut, assembling it, seemed like quite a challenge.

Moreover, as ECDesigns explains in their documentation, "In contrast to “boxed” speakers, open baffle speakers emit sound to both front and rear of the speaker into the room. This makes open baffle speakers less easy to setup than “boxed” speakers. Sound that is transmitted from front can interfere with (delayed) sound from rear and can sometimes cause unwanted resonances in audio frequency range. Most of these resonances are in the lower frequency range and often interact with the room...." concluding that "In reality this means that you will probable need to experiment with different speaker placements in your room, you might also need to use some kind of dampening on inner sides of the speaker or on some parts of your wall/room."

My living room is long (11 meters), but fairly narrow (between 3.5 and 4 meters wide) and has a fairly low ceiling (2.5 meters) typical of modern constructions - I have no special acoustic treatment installed. How would these giant speakers perform in my home ?

Once again, curiosity got the best of me. I ordered the wood online (https://www.tosize.fr/), took the panels to a DIY shop in Paris (https://monatelierenville.com/) to get the speaker placements cut out, and set out to assemble it all.

ECDesigns was very helpful in answering all my questions and made a few valuable suggestions as well. I wired the speakers using copper foil, and added horizontal beams in the back to further improve the rigidity of the baffle. 

The size of the front baffle and speaker positioning was determined based on the well known IEC baffle model. The side panels serve a dual purpose: they add rigidity to the front baffle, minimizing vertical movement of the drivers, and improve the bass response.

The results far exceeded my expectations.

The combination of the powerDAC-S and open baffle speakers provide a level of transparency into the recording that I have simply never heard in the many audio systems that I have listened to, regardless of their price. Instruments are heard with what can be described as full, natural tones and timbre. The sound is refined, dynamic, and the musical picture presented is intricate yet cohesive. As a result, there is a sense of "intimacy" with the recording that leaves a lasting impression! 

Audiophile recordings sound impressive, but even lesser recordings shine through this system. Here is a Qobuz playlist of some of my favorite jazz recordings: https://play.qobuz.com/playlist/8990336. They all sound terrific through the powerDAC-S/open baffles. 

One of my desert island albums is Lester Young and Teddy Wilson's 1956 [Jazz Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jazz_Giants_%2756). Jan Evnesmo, author of a masterful solography of Lester Young describes this recording with the following words: "During two hectic days Prez has found his final, true indian summer, never again to play like this!". The stage is set, and we cannot help but feel some nostalgia when listening to these fine players, together perhaps for a last time. Behind the delicate groove set by the rhtym section, Lester Young's saxophone sounds incredibly vivid, and we can grasp all the subtelties of his craft and the emotions he conveys. We gain a better understanding of the music and even greater respect and admiration for these masters. That's what its all about...

As a side note, listening to such recordings on this system may lead one to reconsider the tradeoffs between digital and analogue... My turntable is now only used to listen to those recordings that are simply not available in a digital format. As with the powerDAC-R, the powerDAC-S offers all these wonderful sounds with even a basic source (CD player, PC...).

In an attempt to convey my enthusiasm for this system, and at the request of some, I made several video recordings of the system using my phone - they can be heard on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPVDgLqppDuwi3k9EGuw42g. In spite of the poor quality of the recording, one may perhaps get an idea of the type of sound to expect when listening to the system live.

Listening to the speakers using other amplifiers (a Lavardin ITX, a Purifi amplifier) gave good results but not as satisfying as when played through the powerDAC-S.

Is the system perfect ? No system is.  Some speakers may offer deeper bass. With complex crossovers or DSP, a ruler flat frequency response can be obtained with some speakers, but at the expense of some other forms of distorsion. One can read about diffraction in open baffles, or the theoretical disadvantages of line arrays - all a source of much anxiety for audiophiles in search of perfection. Every system makes some compromises - one has to decide which aspects are most significant, and the answer may vary according to each listener.

I did struggle with speaker placement, and am still not sure I have found an optimal solution (I am considering some acoustic treatment in my room). Unless your room has terrible acoustics, the optimization of speaker placement should be seen as added bonus, not as a pre-requisite for musical enjoyment.

The output power of the powerDAC-S is limited to 4 Watts per channel. This may be problematic for those who listen to music at loud volumes. If you need to listen to a symphony at the volume level of a front-row concert seat, then this system is not for you.

Listening recently to a "high end" system - 40.000€ speakers in a well treated room - I was impressed by its "clean" and wide sound, but it lacked, to my ears, the exquisite transparency and accuracy of the ECD system that pulls me in completly to the music. That system could play well at very loud levels, but something else was lacking, something I know I can enjoy with the powerDAC-S/open baffles. We all have different tastes and needs. 

Hopefully, this short review will have conveyed an understanding of what can be expected from the powerDAC-S and its companion speakers.
